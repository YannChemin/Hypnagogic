 * database available for integrated agricultural, building, marine, and
 * transportation infrastructure analysis. The 180+ material signatures cover
 * virtually all materials encountered in remote sensing applications for
 * precision agriculture, infrastructure monitoring, environmental assessment,
 * and emergency response scenarios.
 *
 * The library's integration with ALMA Harvest's agricultural finance mission
 * extends to supporting the complete ecosystem of rural infrastructure,
 * transportation networks, and environmental monitoring that underpins
 * successful agricultural operations and sustainable rural development.

 * 
 * USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
 * ===================
 * 
 * To add a new material:
 * 1. Add the material type to the MaterialType enum
 * 2. Create wavelengths array: static const float material_wavelengths[] = {...};
 * 3. Create reflectance array: static const float material_reflectance[] = {...};
 * 4. Add entry to reference_materials array at the bottom
 * 
 * Example for adding "Sugar Beet Mature":
 * 
 * // Add to enum:
 * typedef enum {
 *     ...existing materials...,
 *     SUGAR_BEET_MATURE
 * } MaterialType;
 * 
 * // Add wavelength and reflectance arrays:
 * static const float sugar_beet_mature_wavelengths[] = {300.0, 310.0, 320.0, ...};
 * static const float sugar_beet_mature_reflectance[] = {0.08, 0.09, 0.10, ...};
 * 
 * // Add to reference_materials array:
 * static const ReferenceMaterialData reference_materials[] = {
 *     ...existing materials...,
 *     {"Sugar Beet Mature", SUGAR_BEET_MATURE, sizeof(sugar_beet_mature_wavelengths)/sizeof(float), sugar_beet_mature_wavelengths, sugar_beet_mature_reflectance}
 * };
 * 
 * AGRICULTURAL MONITORING APPLICATIONS:
 * ====================================
 * 
 * Crop Growth Monitoring:
 * - Use early/late vegetative stages to track development
 * - Monitor transitions between phenological stages
 * - Detect stress conditions through spectral changes
 * 
 * Precision Agriculture:
 * - Variable rate application mapping
 * - Yield prediction models
 * - Disease and pest detection
 * - Irrigation management
 * 
 * Environmental Assessment:
 * - Soil type classification
 * - Contamination detection (hydrocarbons, plastics)
 * - Land cover mapping
 * - Change detection analysis
